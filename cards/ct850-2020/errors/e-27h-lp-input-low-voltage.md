**This is E-27H, and it is not any other code printed with the same characters.** `LP` is low input; `HP` in E-28H is high input. The manual asks only for a reboot here, not a supply check.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Code | E-27H |
| Cause, word for word | LP input low voltage. |
| Solution, word for word | Reboot the treadmill may restore. |

The whole printed table is on the card `ct850-2020-inverter-error-code-list`. The only tool section 8-2 asks for is a **multi-meter**.

**The CT850 2024 and CT850ENT 2024 owner's manuals print this row word for word**, cause
and solution alike, in the ERROR CODES table on printed page 42 of the CT850 2024 manual and
printed pages 60 and 61 of the CT850ENT 2024 manual. Both of those pages are flat pictures with
no text layer, and both were read from the rendered page. The 2024 books changed the machine
around this table but not the table: the whole twenty-three-code list is unchanged from the
2020 service manual.

**The CT850ENT 2022 service manual prints this row word for word** in its 8-1 Error code items table, so the 2024 books inherited it from there.

**A Spirit service bulletin on the CT800 #800840 (`spirit-treadmill-ct800-2020-e50h-service-bulletin`) photographs the same list under a card headed *ERROR MESSAGE of New CT800&CT850(2020) - For A/C Transforming System***, with a shorter label for this code - *E-27H: (LP) Low voltage input* - and one solution for the whole list: *all above are related with transformer error, so please check the wiring first before replace a new transformer.* "Transformer" is the bulletin's word for the inverter. On the strength of that heading the card carries the CT800 2020 as well; note that the CT800 2020 service manual itself prints the seven-code DC list and none of these (`spirit-2024-errors-seven-code-table-with-no-hyphen`), so for the CT800 2020 this code rests on the bulletin's heading alone.
